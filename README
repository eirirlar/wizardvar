1) mvn clean install
2) mvn jetty:run
3) open brower to http://localhost:8080/config
4) note the number under "page 1 of 3", call it 'A'
5) click 'next'
6) note the number under "page 2 of 3", call it 'B'. Note how A != B
7) click 'next'
8) note the number under "page 3 of 3", call it 'C'. Note how B == C
9) click 'previous'
10) note the number under "page 2 of 3", call it 'D'. Note how B == C == D
11) click 'previous'
12) note the number under "page 1 of 3", call it 'E'. Note how E != D
13) click 'next' and 'previous' in random order 20 times.
14) Note how the number under "page X of 3" does not change from E anymore.
15) open an editor to the file "src/main/scala/com/kodeworks/snippet/ConfigDisplay.scala"
16) observe how the number in the steps above is initialized as a wizardvar

Is this how wizardvar is supposed to behave? If so, what is the recommended way of maintaining state throughout a wizard?
